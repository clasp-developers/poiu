POIU: Parallel Operator on Independent Units
============================================

POIU is an ASDF extension that will parallelize your Common Lisp builds,
for some build speedup.

Just make sure you use ASDF 2.32 or later, and include
	(asdf:load-system :poiu)
in your build scripts before you build the rest of your software.
It will hook into asdf::*default-plan-class* and
become the default backend for ASDF.

You can get the original behavior of ASDF either
by resetting the default plan class with
	(setf asdf::*default-plan-class* 'asdf/plan:sequential-plan)
or by calling asdf:operate or asdf:load-system with
	(asdf:operate 'asdf:load-op :my-system :plan-class asdf/plan:sequential-plan)

The official web pages for POIU are:
    http://common-lisp.net/project/qitab/
    http://cliki.net/poiu

POIU depends on the new plan-making internals of ASDF 3
as well as on ASDF 3's new UIOP library.
